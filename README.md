# Project-Classification

Abstract:

Nowadays, marketing spending in the banking industry is massive, meaning that it is essential
for banks to optimize marketing strategies and improve effectiveness. Understanding customersâ€™
need leads to more effective marketing plans, smarter product designs and greater customer
satisfaction.

Question/need:

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

Data Description:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Tools:

I will use python because it contains libraries for Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, KNN,etc ). also for exploratory analysis and data cleaning will use (pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy ,etc.).
